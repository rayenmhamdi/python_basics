    "Since its invention in the 1950s, computers have revolutionized many areas of our daily life.\n",
    "- Calculating a route from a website or a GPS\n",
    "- Remote booking of a train or plane ticket\n",
    "- The ability to see and talk with friends halfway around the world\n",
    "\n",
    "All these common acts are possible thanks to computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a computer, even a very powerful one, **is only a machine capable of automatically executing a series of simple operations that have been asked to do it**. He does not have by himself any capacity for learning, judgment, improvisation, **in short any \"intelligence\"**. He just does what he's told to do. The advantage of computers is that they **can manipulate huge amounts of information very quickly and without error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human intervention is required for a computer to perform useful tasks. This is the role of the programmer (also called developer). **He will provide the orders** that the machine must execute by writing programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "A computer program is a **list of commands (orders) telling a computer what to do**. It takes the concrete form of one or more files containing textual commands: these are the orders given to the machine, which are also called **instructions**. The set of files containing the program's instructions constitutes its **source code**.\n",

You will not be understood if you use words that are not English. It is the same thing when writing programs: to be understood by a computer, **a program must respect the rules of the programming language used**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A programming language** defines a way of giving orders to a computer. A bit like a natural language, it has a vocabulary (a set of keywords, each playing a specific role) and its grammar (a set of rules defining the way of writing programs in this language)."
