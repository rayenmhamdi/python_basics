    "- Calculating a route from a website or a GPS\n",
    "- Remote booking of a train or plane ticket\n",
    "- The ability to see and talk with friends halfway around the world\n",

    "However, a computer, even a very powerful one, **is only a machine capable of automatically executing a series of simple operations that have been asked to do it**. He does not have by himself any capacity for learning, judgment, improvisation, **in short any \"intelligence\"**. He just does what he's told to do. The advantage of computers is that they **can manipulate huge amounts of information very quickly and without error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human intervention is required for a computer to perform useful tasks. This is the role of the programmer (also called developer). **He will provide the orders** that the machine must execute by writing programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "A computer program is a **list of commands (orders) telling a computer what to do**. It takes the concrete form of one or more files containing textual commands: these are the orders given to the machine, which are also called **instructions**. The set of files containing the program's instructions constitutes its **source code**.\n",

    "However, you cannot write anything and everything in the source code of a program. Let's say you want to chat with an English speaking person. You will not be understood if you use words that are not English. It is the same thing when writing programs: to be understood by a computer, **a program must respect the rules of the programming language used**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A programming language** defines a way of giving orders to a computer. A bit like a natural language, it has a vocabulary (a set of keywords, each playing a specific role) and its grammar (a set of rules defining the way of writing programs in this language)."
